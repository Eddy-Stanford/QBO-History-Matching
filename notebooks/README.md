# Notebook README
This directory contains notebooks used for the analysis / visualization of results obtained from History Matching and EKI. 
The notebooks contained herein assume you have run iterations of history matching using the scripts provided within this repository. Scripts referencing EKI assume you have run an Ensemble Kalman Inversion using the code available at: (https://github.com/DataWaveProject/EKI_QBO).

## Dependencies
These notebooks utilize Jupyter notebooks, an environment for which can be created from the `requirements.txt` file present within this folder. Note that this differs from the `requirements.txt` present in the root of this repository which contains only the bare minimum dependencies needed to execute the history matching procedure on a remote cluster.
